<h2>His Story:</h2>

<p style="font-size: medium" class="center2"> Jimmy Buffett is a musician who defies categorization: his music has elements of country, raggae, rock and roll, caribbean steel drums, it really has a sound all its own.
Some of his songs are party music, some are slow and introspective. The lyrics are usually thoughtful and well-written, despite commercial hits like "Margaritaville" and "Cheeseburger in Paradise".
He started out in places like Nashville, Mobile, the Florida Keys, Birmingham, and yes of course Atlanta! way back in the '60s and '70s, making folksy, slower rock with caribbean influences that reflected his Southern heritage, but also his beach bum lifestyle that he has since commercialized...
He has clearly sold out in recent years, since around 2000 but his body of work speaks for itself even if you ignore albums like "License to Chill" that have come out since then. Oh! I almost forgot to mention,
his fans are commonly called "Parrotheads" for the colorful way they typically dress up at concerts, with a tropical theme clearly dominant. Being a Parrothead is really an entire lifestyle, many people tailgate before the concerts and of course even Jimmy has groupies! 
Also, his long-time backing band is called the Coral Reefers... draw your own conclusions on that one :P Jimmy plays guitar and sings and the Reefers play the other instruments and do backup vocals.
He has recorded 27 studio albums and 14 live albums, which is over the course of around 50 years now I'd say. Some people call his musical style "Gulf and Western" but I've never liked that label, and besides, all of the Buffett copycats just don't have that special something he brings to the table. 
Jimmy is a natural-born performer who still tours to this day, even though he is in his '70s. I have seen him play at Verizon Ampitheatre and also in Nashville at the ampitheatre by the Tennessee river.
